<h3>The Outcome Oriented Mission</h3>
<p>From a member's perspective, community can feel â€“ far too often -- like an undirected waste of time. (Or, sometimes, an <i>overdirected</i> waste of time: do this, click here, watch those, read these, answer this.) Communities are being built like content sites; is that really what our members need, or is it only what our businesses want? Can we do better? How?</p>
<p>Thoughtful builders are already fighting back, crafting communities that value impact over growth, members over metrics. We call these communities *Outcome Oriented*, in opposition to the default pursuit of content, clicks, and growth. This wiki is an attempt to collect our disparate learnings and to identify the best practices, design patterns, and shared language that will help us all to build better communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Pillars</h3>
<p>1. &nbsp;Member context, not easy metrics (because sometimes churn is good)</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Gather for a purpose (be <i>for</i> something, not just <i>about</i> something)</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Demand less time (minimum impactful intervention, not a pile of homework)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Mechanisms &amp; design patterns</h3>
<p>Be the party starter, not the star</p>
<p>Shine the spotlight, don't stand in it</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Design out the speedbumps</p>
<p>Remove (or relocate) unnecessary steps</p>
<p>Reduce the time cost or complexity</p>
<p>Ratchet up the rewardingness</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just in time learning</p>
<p>Remember what they already know and believe</p>
<p>They don't need the whole map, just the next leg</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="/community-growth-flywheels">Content flywheels</a>, not content creators</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Local news is about local people</p>
<p>Amplification as aspiration (newsletter, blog, homepage, knowledgebase, event)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Too much engagement becomes distraction</p>
<p>Too much content cranks the time cost</p>
<p>The important stuff happens outside of your software</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Set culture by demonstration, not decree</p>
<p>Bad actors follow bad incentives</p>
<p>- Use release valves &amp; disincentivizing</p>
<p>Broken conversations can be scaffolded instead of shut down</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Content can be a campfire or a crutch</p>
<p>Build a product, not a prison</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spaces:</p>
<p>- Spaces are desire paths, not desk drawers</p>
<p>- Add extra spaces and events via mitosis, not meddling</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Introductions:</p>
<p>- Hello is not enough</p>
<p>- Transform a speedbump into a win</p>
<p>- Single player: Bring the future forward, create clarity, provide prioritization</p>
<p>- Multi-player: Revealing weakness invites real feedback</p>
<p>- Your responses are part of the design space</p>
<p>- Do they leave knowing their next proximate goal?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Behavior change:</p>
<p>- Accountabilibot</p>
<p>- Get it on the calendar</p>
<p>- Member success stories</p>
<p>- Clear next step &amp; proximate goal, not possibility cloud</p>
<p>- Just-in-time learning, not upfront homework</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Signal vs. noise</p>
<p>- Discussions with a factual answer are interesting exactly once</p>
<p>- Release valves and disincentivizing</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Member progress</p>
<p>- Self-tagging for credibility (IH) or self-benefit (LI LFW)</p>
<p>- Monitoring real-world progress (EM, UA Twitter/Amazon, PTYA)</p>
<p>- Overheard and overseen (UA)</p>

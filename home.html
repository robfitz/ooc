<h3 class="toc-header" id="the-outcome-oriented-mission"> The Outcome Oriented Mission</h3>
<p>From a member's perspective, community can feel â€“ far too often -- like an undirected waste of time. (Or, sometimes, an <em>overdirected</em> waste of time: do this, click here, watch those, read these, answer this.) Communities are being built like content sites; is that really what our members need, or is it only what our businesses want? Can we do better? How?</p>
<p>Thoughtful builders are already fighting back, crafting communities that value impact over growth, members over metrics. We call these communities *Outcome Oriented*, in opposition to the default pursuit of content, clicks, and growth. This wiki is an attempt to collect our disparate learnings and to identify the best practices, design patterns, and shared language that will help us all to build better communities.</p>
